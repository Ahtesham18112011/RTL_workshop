# Day 3: Combinational and Sequential optimization
Welcome to the day 3 of this workshop! this day discusses about optimization of combinational and sequential circuits. And introduces us to to the techniques for optimization.

## Various methods of optimization

## 1. Constant propagation

In VLSI design, constant propagation is a compiler optimization technique used to replace variables with their constant values during the synthesis process. This optimization can simplify the design, potentially reducing circuit complexity and improving performance by eliminating unnecessary logic. 

**How it works**:

Constant propagation involves analyzing the design description (e.g., a hardware description language like Verilog or VHDL) and identifying variables that have constant values. These variables are then replaced with their actual constant values in subsequent operations. 

**Benefits**:

* Reduced Complexity: By replacing variables with constants, the synthesis tool can potentially simplify the logic, leading to a smaller circuit. 
* Performance Improvement: Simplified logic can result in faster execution and reduced propagation delays. 
* Resource Optimization: Constant propagation can help optimize resource utilization, potentially reducing the number of logic gates or flip-flops required.

## 2. State optimization
In VLSI, state optimization is the process of refining finite state machines (FSMs) to enhance efficiency in integrated circuit design. It focuses on reducing the number of states, optimizing state encoding, merging equivalent states, or eliminating redundancies to lower power consumption, reduce chip area, and improve performance.

**How it is done**:

- **State Reduction**: Equivalent states (producing identical outputs for the same inputs) are identified and merged using algorithms like the partition-based method or implication tables.
- **State Encoding**: States are assigned binary codes (e.g., binary, Gray, or one-hot encoding) to minimize switching activity and logic complexity, often using tools like CAD software.
- **Logic Minimization**: Boolean algebra or tools like Espresso optimize the logic equations governing state transitions.
- **Power Optimization**: Techniques like clock gating or power-aware encoding reduce dynamic power during state changes.


## Cloning
In VLSI, cloning involves duplicating a logic cell or module in a circuit design to optimize performance, reduce power consumption, or improve timing by balancing load or reducing wire length. It maintains signal integrity and meets design constraints. 

**How itâ€™s done**: 
- **Identify Critical Path**: Analyze the design to find cells with high fan-out or timing issues using EDA tools.
- **Duplicate Cell**: Create an identical copy of the target cell/module in the netlist.
- **Redistribute Connections**: Reassign fan-out connections between the original and cloned cells to balance load or shorten wire length.
- **Place and Route**: Use placement tools to position the cloned cell optimally and route new connections.
- **Verify**: Run timing and power analysis to ensure the cloning improves performance without violating constraints.

## Retiming
**Retiming** in VLSI is a design optimization technique used to improve the performance of a digital circuit by repositioning registers (flip-flops) to balance the timing paths without altering the circuit's functionality. It aims to reduce the critical path delay, minimize clock period, or optimize power consumption.

**How it is done**:

1. **Graph Representation**: The circuit is modeled as a directed graph, with nodes as combinational logic and edges representing signal paths.
2. **Register Repositioning**: Registers are moved across combinational logic elements (e.g., gates) to shorten the longest path delay, ensuring the same input-output behavior.
3. **Constraints Analysis**: Timing constraints (setup/hold times) and functional equivalence are preserved using algorithms like the retiming graph or Leiserson-Saxe retiming.
4. **Optimization**: Iteratively adjust register positions to minimize clock period, reduce register count, or optimize power while maintaining correctness.


## Labs on optimization
### Lab 1 

Below is the verilog code foe lab 1:-
```verilog
module opt_check (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?b:0;
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module `opt_check` has three ports: `a` (input), `b` (input), and `y` (output). These are correctly declared.
- **Ternary Operator**: The statement `assign y = a ? b : 0;` means:
- If `a` is true (1), then `y` is assigned the value of `b`.
- If `a` is false (0), then `y` is assigned 0.

Follow the steps given in [Day 1](https://github.com/Ahtesham18112011/RTL_workshop/tree/main/Day_1#6-synthesis-lab-with-yosys) but you need to add a line between  `abc -liberty` and `synth -top`
that is:-
```shell
opt_clean -purge
```
