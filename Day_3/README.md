# Day 3: Combinational and Sequential optimization
Welcome to the day 3 of this workshop! this day discusses about optimization of combinational and sequential circuits. And introduces us to to the techniques for optimization.

## Various methods of optimization

## 1. Constant propagation

In VLSI design, constant propagation is a compiler optimization technique used to replace variables with their constant values during the synthesis process. This optimization can simplify the design, potentially reducing circuit complexity and improving performance by eliminating unnecessary logic. 

**How it works**:

Constant propagation involves analyzing the design description (e.g., a hardware description language like Verilog or VHDL) and identifying variables that have constant values. These variables are then replaced with their actual constant values in subsequent operations. 

**Benefits**:

* Reduced Complexity: By replacing variables with constants, the synthesis tool can potentially simplify the logic, leading to a smaller circuit. 
* Performance Improvement: Simplified logic can result in faster execution and reduced propagation delays. 
* Resource Optimization: Constant propagation can help optimize resource utilization, potentially reducing the number of logic gates or flip-flops required.

## 2. State optimization
In VLSI, state optimization is the process of refining finite state machines (FSMs) to enhance efficiency in integrated circuit design. It focuses on reducing the number of states, optimizing state encoding, merging equivalent states, or eliminating redundancies to lower power consumption, reduce chip area, and improve performance.

**How it is done**:

- **State Reduction**: Equivalent states (producing identical outputs for the same inputs) are identified and merged using algorithms like the partition-based method or implication tables.
- **State Encoding**: States are assigned binary codes (e.g., binary, Gray, or one-hot encoding) to minimize switching activity and logic complexity, often using tools like CAD software.
- **Logic Minimization**: Boolean algebra or tools like Espresso optimize the logic equations governing state transitions.
- **Power Optimization**: Techniques like clock gating or power-aware encoding reduce dynamic power during state changes.


## Cloning
In VLSI, cloning involves duplicating a logic cell or module in a circuit design to optimize performance, reduce power consumption, or improve timing by balancing load or reducing wire length. It maintains signal integrity and meets design constraints. 

**How it’s done**: 
- **Identify Critical Path**: Analyze the design to find cells with high fan-out or timing issues using EDA tools.
- **Duplicate Cell**: Create an identical copy of the target cell/module in the netlist.
- **Redistribute Connections**: Reassign fan-out connections between the original and cloned cells to balance load or shorten wire length.
- **Place and Route**: Use placement tools to position the cloned cell optimally and route new connections.
- **Verify**: Run timing and power analysis to ensure the cloning improves performance without violating constraints.

## Retiming
**Retiming** in VLSI is a design optimization technique used to improve the performance of a digital circuit by repositioning registers (flip-flops) to balance the timing paths without altering the circuit's functionality. It aims to reduce the critical path delay, minimize clock period, or optimize power consumption.

**How it is done**:

1. **Graph Representation**: The circuit is modeled as a directed graph, with nodes as combinational logic and edges representing signal paths.
2. **Register Repositioning**: Registers are moved across combinational logic elements (e.g., gates) to shorten the longest path delay, ensuring the same input-output behavior.
3. **Constraints Analysis**: Timing constraints (setup/hold times) and functional equivalence are preserved using algorithms like the retiming graph or Leiserson-Saxe retiming.
4. **Optimization**: Iteratively adjust register positions to minimize clock period, reduce register count, or optimize power while maintaining correctness.


## Labs on optimization
### Lab 1 

Below is the verilog code foe lab 1:-
```verilog
module opt_check (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?b:0;
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module `opt_check` has three ports: `a` (input), `b` (input), and `y` (output). These are correctly declared.
- **Ternary Operator**: The statement `assign y = a ? b : 0;` means:
- If `a` is true (1), then `y` is assigned the value of `b`.
- If `a` is false (0), then `y` is assigned 0.

Follow the steps given in [Day 1](https://github.com/Ahtesham18112011/RTL_workshop/tree/main/Day_1#6-synthesis-lab-with-yosys) but you need to add a line between  `abc -liberty` and `synth -top`
that is:-
```shell
opt_clean -purge
```

### Lab 2

Below is the verilog code for lab 2:-
```verilog
module opt_check2 (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?1:b;
endmodule

```

### Code Analysis
```verilog
module opt_check2 (input a , input b , output y);
    assign y = a ? 1 : b;
endmodule
```
- **Functionality**: This module acts as a multiplexer. The output `y` is assigned:
  - `1` if the input `a` is true (logic 1).
  - The value of input `b` if `a` is false (logic 0).
- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `a`: Control input (select signal).
  - `b`: Data input.
  - `y`: Output.

Result after simulation:-

### Lab 3

Below is the verilog code for lab 3:-
```verilog
module opt_check2 (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?1:b;
endmodule

```

- **Functionality**: 
  - The module acts as a 2-to-1 multiplexer.
  - Input `a` is the select signal:
    - If `a = 1`, output `y` is assigned `1`.
    - If `a = 0`, output `y` is assigned the value of input `b`.
  - This can be thought of as: `y = a ? 1 : b`, which is equivalent to `y = a | b` in some contexts, but specifically outputs `1` when `a` is true.

- **Port Declarations**:
  - `input a`: Select input (single-bit, implicitly a `wire`).
  - `input b`: Data input (single-bit, implicitly a `wire`).
  - `output y`: Output (single-bit, implicitly a `wire`).
  - The declarations are syntactically correct for Verilog 2001 or later.

Result after synthesis:

### Lab 4

Below is the verilog code for lab 4:-
```verilog
module opt_check4 (input a , input b , input c , output y);
 assign y = a?(b?(a & c ):c):(!c);
 endmodule
```
The Verilog module `opt_check4` you provided implements a combinational logic circuit using nested ternary operators. Let’s analyze the module, explain its functionality, verify its behavior, and address any potential issues or improvements, especially in the context of your previous submissions (e.g., `opt_check2`).

### Code Analysis
```verilog
module opt_check4 (input a, input b, input c, output y);
    assign y = a ? (b ? (a & c) : c) : (!c);
endmodule
```

- **Functionality**:
  - The module has three single-bit inputs: `a`, `b`, and `c`, and one single-bit output `y`.
  - The output `y` is determined by a nested ternary operator:
    - If `a == 1`, then:
      - If `b == 1`, `y = a & c` (since `a == 1`, this simplifies to `y = c`).
      - If `b == 0`, `y = c`.
    - If `a == 0`, `y = !c` (logical NOT of `c`).
  - Simplifying the logic:
    - When `a == 1`, `y = c` (since both `b == 1` and `b == 0` yield `y = c`).
    - When `a == 0`, `y = !c`.
    - Thus, the logic can be expressed as:
      \[
      y = (a \land c) \lor (\neg a \land \neg c)
      \]
      or equivalently, as a multiplexer-like function:
      \[
      y = a ? c : !c
      \]

- **Port Declarations**:
  - Inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` are implicitly single-bit `wire` types.
  - Output `y` is implicitly a single-bit `wire`.
  - The declarations are syntactically correct for Verilog 2001 or later.

- **Context from Previous Submission**:
  - Your previous submissions involved `opt_check2`, a 2-to-1 multiplexer with `y = a ? 1 : b`. This new module, `opt_check4`, is more complex due to three inputs and nested ternary operators, but it also resembles a multiplexer where `a` selects between `c` and `!c`.

### Truth Table
To understand the behavior, let’s derive the truth table for `y = a ? c : !c` (noting that `b` does not affect the output due to the simplification):

| a | b | c | y = a ? c : !c |
|---|---|---|----------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |      1         |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |      0         |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |      1         |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |      0         |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |      0         |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |      1         |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |      0         |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |      1         |

- **Observation**: The input `b` has no effect on `y`, as the expression simplifies to `y = a ? c : !c`. This suggests the module could be simplified by removing `b`.

### Verification Testbench
Here’s a testbench to simulate all input combinations and verify the behavior:
```verilog
module tb_opt_check4;
    reg a, b, c;
    wire y;

    // Instantiate the module
    opt_check4 uut (.a(a), .b(b), .c(c), .y(y));

    initial begin
        $monitor("Time=%0t: a=%b, b=%b, c=%b, y=%b", $time, a, b, c, y);
        // Test all combinations
        a = 0; b = 0; c = 0; #10;
        a = 0; b = 0; c = 1; #10;
        a = 0; b = 1; c = 0; #10;
        a = 0; b = 1; c = 1; #10;
        a = 1; b = 0; c = 0; #10;
        a = 1; b = 0; c = 1; #10;
        a = 1; b = 1; c = 0; #10;
        a = 1; b = 1; c = 1; #10;
        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Time=0: a=0, b=0, c=0, y=1
Time=10: a=0, b=0, c=1, y=0
Time=20: a=0, b=1, c=0, y=1
Time=30: a=0, b=1, c=1, y=0
Time=40: a=1, b=0, c=0, y=0
Time=50: a=1, b=0, c=1, y=1
Time=60: a=1, b=1, c=0, y=0
Time=70: a=1, b=1, c=1, y=1
```

### Potential Issues and Improvements
1. **Redundant Input `b`**:
   - The input `b` does not affect the output `y` because both branches of the inner ternary operator (`b ? (a & c) : c`) yield `c` when `a == 1`. This makes `b` unnecessary.
   - **Simplification**:
     ```verilog
     module opt_check4 (
         input wire a,
         input wire c,
         output wire y
     );
         assign y = a ? c : !c;
     endmodule
     ```
     This simplified version removes `b` and achieves the same functionality.

2. **Explicit Port Types**:
   - For clarity, explicitly declare ports as `wire`:
     ```verilog
     module opt_check4 (
         input wire a,
         input wire b,
         input wire c,
         output wire y
     );
         assign y = a ? (b ? (a & c) : c) : (!c);
     endmodule
     ```

3. **Multi-Bit Support**:
   - If you intended multi-bit inputs/outputs, you’d need to adjust the logic. For example:
     ```verilog
     module opt_check4 #(
         parameter WIDTH = 1
     ) (
         input [WIDTH-1:0] a,
         input [WIDTH-1:0] b,
         input [WIDTH-1:0] c,
         output [WIDTH-1:0] y
     );
         assign y = a ? (b ? (a & c) : c) : (~c);
     endmodule
     ```
     Here, `~c` is the bitwise NOT of `c`, and the operations are performed bit-wise.

4. **Synthesis Considerations**:
   - The nested ternary operator synthesizes to a multiplexer-like circuit where `a` selects between `c` and `!c`. This is efficient, typically using one or two LUTs in an FPGA.
   - The redundant `b` input may be optimized out by synthesis tools, but explicitly removing it improves code clarity and avoids warnings.

### Truth Table Chart
Since you asked about a chart in the context of your previous submission, here’s a bar chart visualizing the truth table for `y` based on inputs `a` and `c` (ignoring `b` since it has no effect). The chart shows the output `y` for each combination of `a` and `c`.

```chartjs
{
  "type": "bar",
  "data": {
    "labels": ["a=0,c=0", "a=0,c=1", "a=1,c=0", "a=1,c=1"],
    "datasets": [{
      "label": "Output y",
      "data": [1, 0, 0, 1],
      "backgroundColor": ["#36A2EB", "#36A2EB", "#FF6384", "#FF6384"],
      "borderColor": ["#2E86C1", "#2E86C1", "#E74C3C", "#E74C3C"],
      "borderWidth": 1
    }]
  },
  "options": {
    "scales": {
      "y": {
        "beginAtZero": true,
        "max": 1,
        "ticks": {
          "stepSize": 1
        }
      }
    },
    "plugins": {
      "legend": {
        "display": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This chart displays `y` (0 or 1) for each combination of `a` and `c`, with distinct colors for clarity on both light and dark themes.

### Alternative Implementation
For clarity or specific synthesis goals, you could rewrite the module using basic gates:
```verilog
module opt_check4 (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    output wire y
);
    wire not_c, sel_a, sel_not_a;
    not (not_c, c);
    and (sel_a, a, c);
    and (sel_not_a, ~a, not_c);
    or (y, sel_a, sel_not_a);
endmodule
```

This gate-level implementation is equivalent but more verbose, and it explicitly shows the logic `y = (a & c) | (!a & !c)`.

### Questions for Clarification
- Was the inclusion of `b` intentional, or is it meant to be unused? If unused, I recommend simplifying the module as shown above.
- Do you need multi-bit support or specific synthesis constraints?
- Would you like further analysis, such as timing analysis, power estimation, or additional test cases?
- Are you comparing `opt_check4` with `opt_check2` from your previous submission? If so, I can provide a detailed comparison (e.g., `opt_check2` is a simpler mux with `y = a ? 1 : b`, while `opt_check4` is `y = a ? c : !c`).
