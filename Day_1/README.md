# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
This Day of the workshop introduces us to the Verilog HDL and explains a Verilog simulator known as Iverilog and its workings. Then explains us how to simulate our Verilog codes with Testbenches and how to obtain a `.vcd` file from the testbench. And then, introduces  us to the Yosys synthesiser, and finally about Sky130 PDK.

**This day is divide into the following parts:**

## 1. Introduction to open-source simulator: iverilog

### Simulator
A simulator is a software tool used to test the functionality of a digital circuit design by applying different input stimuli and observing the output behavior. It depends on the inputs of the design, and changes according to the inputs.

### Design
Design is the actual verilog code or set of verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet with the required specifications.

### Testbench
Verilog testbench is a simulation environment used to verify the functionality and correctness of a digital design described in the Verilog hardware description language (HDL).
The purpose of a testbench is to provide a way to simulate the behavior of the design under various conditions, inputs, and scenarios before actually fabricating the physical hardware. It allows designers to catch bugs, validate functionality, and optimize designs without the cost and time associated with physical prototyping.

### Iverilog simulation flow

As you can see, we put the design and the testbench to iverilog and, in return, it gives us the `.vcd` file which can be used to generate waveforms.

## 2. Lab: good_mux using iverilog

So, first we need to clone the repository which has all the necessory verilog filer and testbenches. Type the following command in the Linux terminal:-

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```
Then, after cloning done, type:-

```shell
cd verilog_files
```
Then, now we  need to install iverilog. type this on terminal:-
``shell
apt install iverilog
```
Then, also install gtkwave for wave production, by typing:-
```shell
apt install gtkwave
```
So, this  is a lab for a mux so i will obtain the `.vcd` file for the mux for the output, by typing:-
```shell
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```
Then type:-
```shell
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```
Then the gtkwave will be opened, you can observe the waveforms

### Analysis of the verilog code
This is the verilog code present in the [good_mux.v](https://github.com/Ahtesham18112011/RTL_workshop/blob/main/Day_1/good_mux.v)
```verilog
module good_mux (input i0 , input i1 , input sel , output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
	if(sel)
		y <= i1;
	else 
		y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```
This Verilog code defines a 2-to-1 multiplexer module.

- **Module Declaration**:
  - Inputs: `i0`, `i1` (data inputs), `sel` (select line)
  - Output: `y` (registered output)
  
- **Functionality**:
  - The `always @ (*)` block is a combinational logic block sensitive to all inputs (`i0`, `i1`, `sel`).
  - If `sel` is `1`, the output `y` is assigned the value of `i1`.
  - If `sel` is `0`, the output `y` is assigned the value of `i0`.
